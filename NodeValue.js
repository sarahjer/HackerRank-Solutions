    Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and a specific position. Counting backwards from the tail node of the linked list, get the value of the node at the given position. A position of 0 corresponds to the tail, 1 corresponds to the node before the tail and so on.
    
    Get Nth element data from the end in a Linked List
    Number of elements in the list will always be greater than N.
    Node is defined as
